Development for the use of Raspberry Pi as sensor platform for the 
Internet of Things.

Starting with simple software (HTML, Javascript, PHP, MySQl, Python 
with GPIO libraries) to have temperature measurements written into MySQL 
database by a Python program. In HTML page pressing a button will start 
reading and displaying the last entry in the database every so many seconds.
Pressing another button will stop this process.

For further developments the website created will be presented in the 
framework of Making Sense - Living Lab for the Internet of Everything.
